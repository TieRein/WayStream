Senior Capstone Project
By: Jacob Chesley

The intention behind this project is to create an app based control system for IoT endpoints.

To follow certain requirements and as a proof of concept, this project will focus specifically on
control of an irrigation system (via electric solenoid) with account credentials, usage statistics,
and simple automated control via NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) weather API.
As an additional proof of concept and practice, the backend will be utilizing AWS free tier
services. These include Lambda, IAM, IoT Core, API Gateway, and RDS. The endpoint control will be a
Raspberry Pi 3B+ with a breadboard controlling a 12V Electric Solenoid Valve (Model 2W-200-20).

Breadboard schematics, Raspberry Pi scripts, and API code will be added to a separate project at a
later date.

The proposal and functional requirements are included under Proposal.docx.
